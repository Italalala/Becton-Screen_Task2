In this Processing project, I've created a generative artwork exploring the issue of climate change. The work draws from my own experience
with flooding during my senior year of high school; it's deeply personal, but also speaks to a condition that is sadly nearing 
universality. In what was named a "1000-year flood", my hometown was battered and broken by
unprecedented rainfall dumped by Hurricane Joaquin. I this work I shift back and forth between a current image of one of the main roads
in my neighborhood, where it is sunny and beautiful, lifted from Google Maps streetview, and an image I took of the same road during the
flooding, when it was a gaping hole, destroyed by the rushing current. The pictures layer over eachother chaotically and periodically are
replaced by flashes of terrifying natural moments: lightning, a tornado, etc. But underlying all of the chaos is a highly
structured system, which though it propagates randomly, follows a set logic hard coded into the work. With this gesture I aim to 
simultaneously highlight the disastrous potentialities that underly the experiences of place in a time over which the looming
shadow of climate catastrophe slides steadily faster, and to point out the systematic ways by which our society pushes itself towards 
those futures, despite the seeming chaos of the environmental changes themselves.

On the walls outside the primary display, across a series of disjointed panel displays, I programmed a looping sweep from green to 
red, like an alarm going off, a symbolic system ubiquitous in its simplicity.

The project is run on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and is set to start on boot.
